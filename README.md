Overview of Verilog Logic Gates Project
Objective
The objective of this project is to have basic digital logic circuits designed, implemented, and simulated using Verilog hardware description language (HDL) and ModelSim simulation software. A comprehensive understanding of digital logic design is aimed to be provided, including the creation of various logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) and combinational circuits (such as adders and multiplexers). By the end of the project, the functionality of these circuits is to be verified through simulation and waveform analysis.

Key Activities
1.Learning Verilog HDL:
The syntax and semantics of Verilog are to be understood.
Familiarity with different Verilog constructs such as modules, ports, wires, and registers is to be developed.
2.Designing Logic Gates:

Various basic logic gates are to be implemented using Verilog:
AND gate
OR gate
NOT gate
NAND gate
NOR gate
XOR gate
XNOR gate
3.Designing Combinational Circuits:

More complex circuits using basic gates are to be implemented:
Half Adder
Full Adder
2-to-1 Multiplexer
Writing Testbenches:

4.Testbenches for each logic gate and combinational circuit are to be developed.
Different input combinations are to be applied, and outputs are to be observed to verify correct functionality.
5.Simulation in ModelSim:
The Verilog code and testbenches are to be compiled.
Simulations using ModelSim are to be run to generate waveforms.
Waveforms are to be analyzed to ensure the circuits perform as expected.
6.Verification and Debugging:

The correctness of the logic gates and combinational circuits is to be verified by comparing the simulation results with expected results.
Any issues found during simulation are to be debugged.
